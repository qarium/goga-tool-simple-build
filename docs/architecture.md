# Architecture

The tool is a single cell — a directory with a `CODEMANIFEST` contract and a consumer-facing
practice in `.usages/`. Contracts are read-only: when implementation and contract disagree, the
implementation is what gets fixed.

## Cell map

| Cell | Role |
|---|---|
| [`goga_tool_simple_build`](api/facade.md) | Package facade — the platform subscription (one hook) and the single API surface |

## Import graph

```
goga_tool_simple_build            (package facade, the hook + subscription)
```

The cell has no imports: it declares no `Imports` and depends on no other cell. The platform
types (`HookRegistrar`, `ConfigAmendment`) are referenced under `TYPE_CHECKING` only — the
facade stays import-clean with or without goga installed.

## Amendment data flow

The amendment action fires at the configuration load moment of every config-consuming goga
surface — the host-side commands (`build`, `pipeline`, `lint`, `contract`, `install`,
`config`, `topics`, `usages status`, `usages sync`) and the in-container entrypoints alike:

1. goga calls `register_hooks(hooks)` when a command first reaches a hook checkpoint.
2. The registration subscribes exactly one hook: address `config` / `amend_config`, name
   `build_presets`.
3. The platform delivers a `ConfigAmendment` context to the hook.
4. The hook reads exactly the guard-leaf chain `build.review.strategy` from the context's
   configuration — absent intermediate branches read as absent; no neighboring leaf is read.
5. An authored strategy other than `short` raises: the platform stops the hosting command
   with a clean error naming the tool, the action, and the path — never the authored value —
   and the tool's whole contribution is discarded.
6. Otherwise the hook buffers three apply-where-silent amendments through `context.set`:
   `build.review.strategy` = `short`, `build.review.additional.patience` = `1`,
   `build.review.additional.max_iterations` = `3`.
7. The platform merge keeps authored values per path — the presets fill only what the author
   left silent — and prints the amendment summary to stderr. The amended configuration exists
   only in-memory, for the duration of the run.

## Runtime properties

- The package runs inside a goga-provided interpreter: runtime dependencies stay empty — goga
  is provided by the ecosystem and is declared only in the test extra, unpinned above the
  supported line.
- The facade module stays import-clean — a broken import is fatal to every goga command.
- The hook is a pure function of the delivered context: no state, no cache, no clock or
  environment reads; identical facts produce the identical contribution.
- The read footprint is the guard-leaf chain only; the write footprint is exactly the three
  leaf paths — no other configuration path, no tasks-pass settings, no environment values.
- No agent validation of any kind: the missing-agent error belongs to the goga platform's
  agent value guard and inheritance.
- Failures propagate as clean command errors through the hard action — no internal exception
  handling; nothing partial applies.
