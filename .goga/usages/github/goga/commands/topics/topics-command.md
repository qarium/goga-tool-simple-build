# commands/topics — the topics command group

Consumer scenarios of the `goga topics` command group. For users who
manage work as topics: boarding, creating, publishing an existing
branch, updating, propagating, switching, deleting, and clearing; for
the command facade that registers the group.

The group scopes every subcommand to one year (--year/-y, default the
current year); the board subcommand reads remote-tracking refs with
--remote/-r, adds the todo and delivery columns with --info/-i,
filters by hosting
branch with the repeatable --host and by topic slug with the
repeatable --topic, switches to the expanded per-host audit view with
--per-host, and prints machine-readable records with --json; the
create subcommand creates fresh work without switching by default,
switches under --switch/-s, and publishes under --publish/-p; --todo/-t
takes a value, or no value to read the todo from stdin; the clear
subcommand removes the merged topics of the scoped year.

A topic exists exactly as long as its own branch exists. The board
shows only topics that still have their own branch; a topic whose
history survives only in merged hosts appears in no view — its
history stays reachable through git itself.

## Boarding all work

    goga topics board
    goga topics --year 2025 board
    goga topics board --remote
    goga topics board --info
    goga topics board --host main --host release/1.3
    goga topics board --topic feature-foo
    goga topics board --host main --topic feature-foo

The default board shows exactly one entry per topic of the scoped
year that still has its own branch — the hosting branch whose branch
part (the whole name of a local branch, the short name of a
remote-tracking ref) normalizes into the topic slug; a
remote-tracking ref qualifies, so remote-only topics keep their
entry; a topic whose history survives only in merged hosts shows no
entry. The table columns are topic,
branch, hosts, todo (--info), delivery (--info), statuses. The branch column shows the
own branch —
several colliding own branches resolve deterministically (the
current branch, else a local branch over a remote-tracking one, else
the alphabet). The hosts column lists every branch carrying the
topic's history, the own branch included, alphabetical; every host
prints on its own line of the column. The statuses are the own branch's
maximal statuses — artifacts that exist solely on merged hosts do not
advance them. The current branch's entry carries `*`. The todo cell shows the
first line of the topic's `todo.md` that yields text after leading
`#` markers are stripped and the edges trimmed; a topic without
`todo.md` shows an empty cell. The delivery cell shows the topic's
divergence against topics.base_ref — base (the own tip equals the
base), up-to-date (the topic carries the base with no lag),
propagated (the base carries the whole topic), or
need-update (the pair diverged); a topic
without a configured or resolvable base shows an empty cell. An empty
board prints nothing and
exits 0. Reading is strictly read-only — no checkout, no fetch, no
mutation. The board never fetches and never fails on the base.

--host NAME (repeatable) filters by exact hosting-branch display
name; --topic SLUG (repeatable) filters by exact topic slug; several
values of one filter unite, and the two filters compose — an entry
(or row) survives both. The own-branch requirement stands first: a
filter never resurrects a topic without an own branch. An unknown
name or slug leaves an empty board (or [] under --json) with exit 0 —
never an error.

## Auditing every hosting branch

    goga topics board --per-host
    goga topics board --per-host --info

--per-host switches to the expanded audit view: one row per topic and
hosting branch of the own-branched topics, showing that branch's own
statuses. The table keeps the
established layout (topic, branch, statuses; the todo and delivery
columns under --info — topic, branch, todo, delivery, statuses); the
current marker
applies per hosting branch, the remote
marker per ref, and a local branch still absorbs its remote twin.

## Consuming the board as JSON

    goga topics board --json
    goga topics board --json --remote
    goga topics board --per-host --json

--json prints the board as a pretty-printed JSON array. Default
records carry exactly the fields topic, branch, hosts, statuses,
current, remote, todo, divergence — todo is a string or null,
divergence is base, up-to-date, propagated, need-update, or null.
Per-host records
carry topic, branch, statuses, current, remote, todo, divergence — no
hosts. The divergence key is always present, never omitted. The
year scoping and --remote apply exactly as to the table. An empty
board prints []. --json --info is a clean error — the todo is always
present in JSON. The field names and record shapes are a stable
contract for external tools; the key order is not.

## Creating fresh work

    goga topics create Feature/Foo_Bar --from-current
    goga topics create Feature/Foo_Bar --base-ref origin/main
    goga topics create Feature/Foo_Bar -t "Payment retry"
    printf 'First line\nSecond line\n' | goga topics create Feature/Foo_Bar --todo --from-current
    goga topics create Feature/Foo_Bar -s
    goga topics --year 2025 create Feature/Foo_Bar --base-ref origin/main

Creates the branch off the base — --base-ref, topics.base_ref of
.goga/config.yml, or --from-current (the current HEAD); no base at
all is a clean error before anything else, naming the flag and the
configuration line. The preflight (an empty slug, an occupied branch
name or slug, the current branch hosting the same slug) runs before
any todo source: creating the existing is an error with a hint to the
board — the todo of an existing topic is `goga topics switch ID
--todo`.

The --todo/-t option takes an optional value. With a value it is the
todo (an empty value counts as absent). Without a value it declares
stdin as the source: pipe the multi-line todo in and it becomes the
todo — no editor opens, nothing is asked, and the publication ask
never appears. Without the option, a terminal opens the external
editor ($VISUAL/$EDITOR/vi) — an empty or unchanged file cancels the
entry; without a terminal and without a value the command is a clean
error naming --todo "...". Piping content while declaring no source
(neither a value nor the value-less --todo) is a clean error naming
--todo — piped content is never silently ignored; piping bytes that
are not UTF-8 with the value-less --todo is the same clean error. A
terminal stdin is never read; a pipe is read fully exactly once, at
todo-resolution time. The stdin todo works on every creation path —
the default, --switch/-s, and --publish/-p.

By default the resolved text becomes one quarantined commit —
todo.md on top of the base — and the branch is planted at it: you
stay on your branch, nothing lands in the working copy, and the todo
is required. --switch/-s checks out the fresh branch instead — the
topic directory and todo.md appear in the working copy uncommitted,
and the todo is optional; --switch acts only without --publish. On a
terminal without --publish the "Publish the branch to origin? [y/N]"
ask appears only when a todo was obtained and did not come from
stdin; confirming publishes with a full rollback on failure, declining
takes the local path.

## Creating and publishing fresh work

    goga topics create Feature/Foo_Bar --publish -t "Payment retry" --base-ref origin/main
    goga topics create Feature/Foo_Bar -p -t "Payment retry" -c "chore: new topic {slug}"

The publish path needs no terminal and asks nothing: the todo comes
from --todo/-t or the piped stdin under the value-less form. The base
comes from --base-ref, topics.base_ref, or --from-current. --commit/-c
(topics.create.commit, default `Create topic '{slug}'`) stays
publication-only — an error without --publish; the {base} placeholder
is available beside {slug}. A failed publication
rolls back fully — the branch is deleted and one clean error names
the reason.

## Updating a topic from its base

    goga topics update
    goga topics update feat-x
    goga topics update feat-x --base-ref origin/main
    goga topics update -p

Refreshes the topic from its base — the current topic when the
identifier is omitted, the identified one otherwise (the switch tiers;
several candidates offer the numbered list). The base comes from
--base-ref or topics.base_ref; no base at all is a clean error naming
the flag and the configuration line. The strategy comes from
topics.update.strategy (merge | rebase | ff-else-merge |
ff-else-rebase, default merge) and the message template from
topics.update.commit — no CLI overrides. No confirmation is asked.
--publish/-p pushes the refreshed branch after success (a plain push
after a merge, a protected force after a rebase). The targeted fetch of
the base is reported by one stdout line before it runs. Exit 0/1.

## publish

`goga topics publish [IDENTIFIER]` delivers an existing topic branch
to origin. Omitted IDENTIFIER addresses the current topic.

    goga topics publish          # publish the current topic
    goga topics publish feat-x   # publish the identified topic

- Exit 0 on pushed, up-to-date, and remote-ahead alike; divergence is
  a clean error naming both tips (reconcile via git, re-run).
- No flags: no confirmation, no force; the command reads no
  configuration keys.
- The result is exactly one stdout line naming the outcome kind.

## Propagating a topic into its base

    goga topics propagate feat-x
    goga topics propagate --yes
    goga topics propagate feat-x --base-ref release/2.0.0

Delivers the topic's work into its base and pushes — the push is
inherent, there is no --publish flag. The strategy comes from
topics.propagate.strategy (merge | ff | squash, default merge), the
message from topics.propagate.commit. Exactly one confirmation names
the topic, the target, and the push; --yes/-y skips it (a
non-terminal without it is a clean error; a declined answer exits 0
with nothing done). The topic stays alive after the delivery — cleanup
remains the separate clear. Exit 0/1.

## Switching to existing work

    goga topics switch history-com
    goga topics switch history-com --todo

Resolves the identifier — exact branch name, exact topic slug, then
prefixes — and switches. Several candidates offer a numbered list with
statuses; without interactive input the command fails with the list.
Already being on the host is an idempotent success. A dirty working
tree is a clean error when a mutation is needed. With --todo the
editor opens with the topic's todo.md after the switch: saving
overwrites the file without a commit, cancelling leaves it untouched.
--todo on a branch without a topic, or without a terminal, is a clean
error before the switch. Switching is always local.

## Deleting topics

    goga topics delete feature-foo release-1-3-0
    goga topics delete feature-foo --yes

Resolves every identifier (branch name, topic slug, prefix — plus
topic directories of the year no branch hosts); an unknown or
ambiguous identifier cancels the whole call before anything is
removed. One confirmation for the whole list — "Delete N topics?
[y/N]" with the topic-to-branch pairs; --yes/-y skips it (a
non-terminal without --yes is a clean error; the -y collision with the
group --year is resolved by position). The deletion removes the
topic's own branch — the local branch and its origin twin, the local
first; a failed remote deletion restores
the local branch and stops with one clean error. The topic directory
joins the deletion exactly when no branch surviving the deletion
carries the topic — the target's own branch is not a gate. A topic
without its own branch is a clean error: there is no branch and
nothing to delete — it is history. The current branch hosting a
target is a clean error — switch away first. Unmerged commits never
block: the deletion is unconditional after the confirmation.

## Clearing merged topics

    goga topics clear
    goga topics clear --base-ref origin/release/2.0.0
    goga topics --year 2025 clear --base-ref release/2.0.0
    goga topics clear -y

Removes every own-branched topic of the scoped year whose history
the base carries — the base tree contains the topic directory of the
year. The base comes from --base-ref or topics.base_ref of
.goga/config.yml; no base at all is a clean error before anything
else, naming the flag and the configuration line. The base is any
resolvable revision (a local branch, origin/..., a tag), is only
read, is never moved or pushed, and being on it is not an error.

Branchless topics are out of scope silently. A year without merged
topics succeeds with one result line (exit 0). One confirmation for
the whole list — "Clear N topics? [y/N]" with the topic-to-branch
pairs; --yes/-y skips it (a non-terminal without --yes is a clean
error; the -y collision with the group --year is resolved by
position). The deletion of each target is that of `goga topics
delete` — own branch and origin twin, restore-on-failure with one
clean error, earlier targets stay removed, topic_deleted fires per
fully removed target. Other hosts of a target are untouched. The
current branch being a target's own branch is a clean error — switch
away first.

## Exit codes

Every subcommand exits 0 on success (an empty board, [], an empty
clear scope, and a declined confirmation included) and 1 on error,
with the error on stderr and no traceback.
