# pipeline — host-side goga pipeline command

`goga pipeline` is a single Click command with five explicit forms. Every
form launches the goga Docker container and invokes python -m goga.pipeline
inside it. The host never reads pipeline files directly — the runtime
boundary to the in-container pipeline is docker.

## Forms

| Invocation | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `goga pipeline` (no name, no `--list`) | error: `Missing pipeline name. Use "goga pipeline --list" to list available pipelines, or provide a pipeline name.` — stderr, exit 1, no docker activity |
| `goga pipeline --list` / `-l` | flat list of pipeline names (project source entries suffixed with ` (project)`) |
| `goga pipeline --list --info` / `-l -i` | overview: every pipeline as a `* <name>` bullet block with indented `name:`/`description:` field lines |
| `goga pipeline NAME --info` / `-i` | card of one pipeline: `name:`/`description:` fields, a `---` separator, then `* <id>:` stage bullets with indented `title:` lines in execution order; nothing runs |
| `goga pipeline NAME` | run |

`--list` and a name together is an error (mutually exclusive, clean message,
exit 1). `--info` is a modifier, not a mode: without a name and without
`--list` it still yields the missing-name error.

## Options (selection)

| Option | Type | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| -l / --list | flag | select the listing forms |
| -i / --info | flag | show instead of act (overview with --list, card with NAME) |
| -t / --topic ID | str | bring the repository onto the requested work (branch name, topic slug, or prefix) before the run, creating it when nothing hosts it; run form only |
| --todo | flag | open the external editor with the topic's todo.md after the switch or the fast creation (run form only; a clean error without --topic and on a non-terminal before any git or docker activity; no short form — -t stays with --topic) |
| -w / --workflow NAME | str | apply an explicit workflow (run and card); the file must exist (early host validation) |
| --no-workflow | flag | disable workflow resolution (run and card) |
| -p / --parallel N | int | max concurrently executing stages; run only |
| -s / --skip NAME | repeatable | exclude a stage; run and card forms |
| -c / --clean | flag | wipe persistent afm state before launch; run only |
| -u / --update | flag | refresh the image before the flat list and the run; no-op in the info forms |

## Continuing or starting work

    goga pipeline development --topic history-com
    goga pipeline development -t release-1-3-0
    goga pipeline refinement -t prune-history-and-new-status
    goga pipeline development --topic history-com --todo
    goga pipeline refinement -t prune-history-and-new-status --todo

Brings the repository onto the requested work — an exact branch name, an
exact topic slug, or their prefix — and then launches the usual run. When
nothing hosts the identifier, fresh work is created instead: the branch
named as entered and the topic directory of the year
(`Created branch <name> and topic <year>/<slug>`). The switch or creation
completes on the host before any docker activity; a repeated invocation
already on the host continues without switching. The flat list, overview,
and card forms silently ignore -t. Several candidates without a terminal, a
dirty working tree on a switch, or an unusable (empty-slug) or occupied
name without a terminal is a clean error before any launch.

With --todo the editor opens with the topic's todo.md after the
repository is on the work: the existing content when the topic has a
todo, an empty entry otherwise; a branch without a topic gets its
topic directory created first — the fast process is never interrupted.
Saving overwrites todo.md without a commit; an empty or unchanged file
leaves it untouched. Without a terminal --todo is a clean error before
any git or docker activity, and so is --todo without --topic — the entry
needs requested work; --list and --info forms ignore the flag
silently.

## Flag behavior in the list/info forms

- Ignored in the listing forms (no-op, no side effects): `-e/--env`, `--proxy`, `-c/--clean`,
  `-p/--parallel`, `--add-host`, `-t/--topic`, `--todo`.
- `-u/--update`: works in `--list` without `--info`; no-op in both `--info` forms.
- `-w/--workflow`, `--no-workflow`, and `-s/--skip`: validated as usual (exclusivity and, for
  -w, file existence) and honored by the card form — the same flags produce the same
  composition in card and run forms.
- All errors go to stderr with a non-zero exit code; stdout stays clean for the listing,
  overview, and card output.

## Docker shapes

- Run form: full shape — allocated port, env-file, persistent afm state
  mount, caller-side signal handler. No afm-config overlay exists: the whole
  `config.yaml` is written in-container by the run coordination, after its
  load-and-amend of the effective configuration.
- List/info forms: minimal read-only shape — none of the above. The decision travels in the
  subcommand argv: `-m goga.pipeline list [--info]` or `-m goga.pipeline run NAME --info
  [-w WORKFLOW | --no-workflow] [-s NAME]...`.

## Environment carriage (run form)

The env-file carries the launch base layers in ladder order: home.env, git
identity, the raw CLI `-e` lines, then the engine variables (`AFM_DIR`,
`AFM_DOCKER_FILE_ROOTS`, the proxy triple) — skipping a key the CLI
explicitly supplied (the documented `-e AFM_DOCKER_FILE_ROOTS=...` escape
hatch keeps winning) — then the `GOGA_EXTRA_ENV` payload: the same CLI
entries encoded per the carriage contract of goga/docker, so the
in-container run applies them above the task env layer at the afm launch.
The task env layer (`pipeline.env`) and the agent (`pipeline.agent`) never
travel through the host: they resolve in-container from the effective
configuration the in-container load-and-amend produces.

## File manager roots (run form)

The afm dashboard file manager shows the directories the user may browse.
The run form (`goga pipeline NAME`) delivers that set to afm through the
AFM_DOCKER_FILE_ROOTS container environment variable; the listing and info
forms never produce it.

| Root | Source | Presence |
|---|---|---|
| project | the mounted project at `/workspace` | always — listed first, read-write |
| extra | a directory mount from a `home.docker.run` `-v`/`--volume` token | when the token's host part exists as a directory |

File mounts, named volumes, missing host paths, and
the persistent afm state directory never become roots.

Exposing an extra directory — add a volume token to ~/.goga/config.yml:

    docker:
      run:
        - "-v /home/me/data:/home/goga/data"
        - "-v /home/me/readonly-stuff:/home/goga/ro:ro"

- the host part must exist as a directory at launch time
- append `:ro` to expose the directory read-only (`mount_read_only: true`)
- the label shown in the dashboard is the full container path
- roots appear in token order, after the project root

An explicit user entry wins over the launcher-produced value:

    goga pipeline myflow -e AFM_DOCKER_FILE_ROOTS=<custom-base64>

With unchanged mounts, every launch writes the same value: the payload is a
compact JSON (`{"version":1,"roots":[...]}`) encoded as standard base64
with padding.

## -p vs docker -p

The user-facing -p/--parallel is a Click option. The Docker port-publish
-p <port>:<port> is an internal translated docker token assembled by the
run launcher from the allocated port (run form
only). Different namespaces (Click CLI vs docker run argv) — no collision.
The user never authors the docker -p.

## Threading chains

    goga pipeline NAME            → run (full shape)
    goga pipeline NAME -t feat/x  → switch-or-create → run (full shape)
    goga pipeline --list          → minimal shape: list
    goga pipeline --list --info   → minimal shape: list --info
    goga pipeline NAME --info     → minimal shape: run NAME --info [-w WF | --no-workflow] [-s NAME]...

    goga pipeline NAME -p N
      → docker run … -m goga.pipeline run NAME --port PORT --parallel N
        → the in-container run launches afm bounded to N concurrent stages

    goga pipeline NAME -w hardening -s build -s test
      → docker run … -m goga.pipeline run NAME --port PORT -w hardening -s build -s test
        → the in-container run resolves the workflow and applies the skips

    goga pipeline NAME -e KEY=V
      → docker run … -m goga.pipeline run NAME --port PORT
        (env-file: home.env, git identity, KEY=V, engine vars, GOGA_EXTRA_ENV)
        → the in-container run applies the effective pipeline.env with KEY=V
          above it at the afm launch

Absent ⇒ no flag ⇒ auto-match / no skip / unbounded. Absent `-e` ⇒ no payload
line value beyond the empty-mapping payload ⇒ the task env layer alone.
