# schema — registering hooks

How a `goga_tool_*` package subscribes its hooks to the schema domain
action. For tool package authors; no goga code changes are needed.

The domain opens two hard actions — the cell amendment, a
read-and-contribute view delivered during the walk, and the validation
gate, an observe-and-veto pass over the final assembled tree. The cell
amendment is that read-and-contribute view over the authored facts of
one cell; both actions are hard.

## The events

| Address | Error class | Fires |
|---|---|---|
| `schema / amend_cell` | hard | At the generation moment of every entry path that builds the project map (`goga schema` and the schema routine). One delivery per cell whose node survives the filters — cells in tree order, tools in enumeration order within each cell. |
| `schema / validate_schema` | hard | Once over the final assembled tree of every entry path that builds the project map (`goga schema` and the schema routine) — after the tools overlay and the filters, before serialization. The walk runs to completion; one violation per vetoing or crashing tool. |

## Subscribe

```python
def register_hooks(hooks):
    hooks.subscribe("schema", "amend_cell", "coverage", cover_cell)
```

- `domain` — always `"schema"`; `action` — from the table; `name` —
  unique per tool per address; `hook` — the callable executed when the
  event fires.
- A hook receives values only for the parameters it declares by the
  fixed offered names: `context`, `self`.

## The amendment view

`amend_cell` delivers a `CellAmendment` view per tool, once per cell.
The reads: `cell` — the authored facts of the cell being built
(read-only; attribute assignment is blocked): `path`, `description`,
`types` (the entity and routine names), `usages` (the usages file
names), `dependencies` (each with `path`, `types`, `usages`), and
`children` (the authored children paths of the document tree). The
view never carries another tool's contributions, generated data, or
the run's filter parameters.

```python
def cover_cell(context):
    if is_interesting(context.cell.path):
        context.contribute(
            {
                "coverage": measure_coverage(context.cell.path),
                "owner": owning_team(context.cell.types),
            }
        )
```

- `contribute(facts)` buffers one mapping of facts for this cell —
  fact names to JSON-representable values; a later contribution of
  your tool on the same cell merges key-wise, a later write replacing
  an earlier one on key conflict.
- Your facts land on the cell node under your tool identity inside
  the `tools` wrapper area: `tools -> {<tool> -> {<fact>: <value>}}`.
  The identity is assigned by goga from the package name — a tool
  never names itself.

## The validation view

`validate_schema` delivers a `SchemaValidation` view per tool: the
read-only final tree (`context.tree` — recursive `SchemaNode` with
`path`, `description`, `types`, `usages`, `dependencies`, `children`,
`tools`, the overlay included) and `veto(reason)`.

    def validate_tree(context):
        for node in context.tree:
            if broken(node):
                context.veto(f"{node.path}: broken shape")
                return

- Veto or crash = exactly one violation of your tool (tool, hook,
  reason); every subscribed tool runs — no early stop.
- On any violation: nothing on stdout, one merged error on stderr,
  exit 1. Observe and veto only — the tree is never modified.
- With no subscriptions the output is byte-for-byte unchanged.

## The merge rules

- One JSON mapping per tool per cell; multiple hooks of your tool
  merge key-wise in registration order, later writes replacing
  earlier ones on key conflict.
- Tools never collide — each namespace lives under its own identity
  key; base fields and extensions stay structurally separated.
- Empty objects never appear: the `tools` key exists on a node iff at
  least one tool wrote at least one fact; your key exists iff you
  wrote at least one fact. An empty `contribute` contributes nothing.
- Tools are mutually blind — every hook reads the same authored
  facts; each tool's contribution commits as a unit, in enumeration
  order, per cell.

## Failure treatment

The action is hard. The first failing hook in the delivery walk stops
the command with a clean error naming the tool, the action, and the
failing cell path — no partial map is printed. A structurally
malformed contribution — a non-mapping payload, non-string keys,
non-JSON-serializable values, or an empty mapping at any nesting
level — fails the same way; only JSON-representable facts are valid. A tool package whose
facade fails to import (raised as ImportError at the registry build)
stops the command the same way, the error naming the package — keep
the package facade import-clean.

## The run output

With no subscriptions — or no tool packages installed — `goga schema`
output is byte-identical to the map without the extension: no `tools`
key appears anywhere. The six base fields of every node are exactly
what they would be without the extension. The map and the CODEMANIFEST
files are never modified; repeated runs with the same tools reproduce
the output deterministically. stdout stays data-clean JSON — every
warning and diagnostic goes to stderr.

## Integration scenarios

- **Per-cell knowledge publication** — read `context.cell` (which
  types live here? which usages files? what does the cell import?)
  and publish your tool's facts about that cell.
- **Selective coverage** — contribute only on the cells your tool
  understands; silence is free — an absent key never appears.
- **Fact namespacing inside your area** — structure your facts as
  `{"<fact>": <value>}` freely; your identity key is the namespace,
  fact names are yours alone.
