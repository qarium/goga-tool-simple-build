# config — registering hooks

How a `goga_tool_*` package subscribes its hooks to the config domain
action. For tool package authors; no goga code changes are needed.

The domain opens one action — the configuration amendment. It is a
read-and-amend view over the authored project configuration, delivered at
the load moment of `.goga/config.yml`, after the authored file is loaded
and before any consumer reads the configuration. It is a hard action.

## The events

| Address | Error class | Fires |
|---|---|---|
| `config / amend_config` | hard | At the project-configuration load moment of every config-consuming surface — the host-side commands that load `.goga/config.yml` (pipeline, lint, contract, install, config, build, topics, usages status, usages sync) and the in-container entrypoints (the pipeline run coordination, the build entrypoint). |

A failing moment fires nothing: a missing or structurally invalid
configuration file fails in the loader before the checkpoint.

## Subscribe

```python
def register_hooks(hooks):
    hooks.subscribe("config", "amend_config", "hardening", harden_config)
```

- `domain` — always `"config"`; `action` — from the table; `name` — unique
  per tool per address; `hook` — the callable executed when the event
  fires.
- A hook receives values only for the parameters it declares by the fixed
  offered names: `context`, `self`.

## The amendment view

`amend_config` delivers a `ConfigAmendment` view per tool. The reads:
`config` — the authored loaded project configuration itself, read-only,
values and environment mappings included with their values (attribute
assignment is blocked). Compose new environment values from the existing
ones freely — secrecy is enforced on the output side: goga never prints
a configuration value.

```python
def harden_config(context):
    if context.config.build is None:
        context.set("build.agent", "claude")  # applies only where authored is silent
    context.set("pipeline.env.LOG_LEVEL", "DEBUG")  # materializes the absent branch
    context.force("topics.base_ref", "origin/main")  # overwrites the authored value
```

- `set(path, value)` buffers an amendment that applies only where the
  authored configuration is silent at the path — the absence markers of
  the loaded model (`None`, `{}`, `[]`); authored emptiness (`False`,
  `""`) is authored, not silent — a `set` on it is dropped, only
  `force` overwrites.
- `force(path, value)` buffers an amendment that overwrites the authored
  value — the explicit override intent.
- Paths address model-known leaves in the authored vocabulary — the same
  keys the file uses: `language`, `image`, `build.agent`,
  `build.env.KEY`, `build.review.roles` (a list-valued leaf, replaced
  wholesale), `build.review.additional.patience`,
  `pipeline.env.KEY`, `tools.<name>`, `usages.<group>.<dep>.ref`,
  `lint.ignore`, `topics.base_ref`, and every other leaf of the
  configuration model. A model-known path stays addressable when its
  intermediate branch is absent — the amendment materializes the missing
  nodes.
- Materializing an absent `usages.<group>.<dep>` branch requires the
  amendments to supply its `git` too — a materialized dep without `git`
  is the same hard structural failure. Amended `git`/`ref` values must
  be non-empty strings and `root` a safe relative subpath (no `..`, no
  absolute) — blank `git`/`ref` and unsafe `root` values are structural
  failures; a blank `root` means no root.
- A later amendment of your tool on the same path replaces its earlier
  one.

## The merge rules

The contributions merge deterministically — the same tools and the same
authored file always produce the same effective configuration:

- Authored-wins by default: a `set` on a path where the authored
  configuration is not silent is dropped silently — no warning, no error.
- On one path `force` beats any `set` regardless of enumeration order.
- Among amendments of equal intent the later tool in enumeration order
  wins.
- Tools are mutually blind — every hook reads the authored configuration;
  each tool's contributions commit as a unit, in enumeration order.

## Failure treatment

The action is hard. The first failing tool stops the command with a clean
error naming the tool and the action; the failing tool's whole
contribution is discarded — nothing partial is applied, the command does
not run. A structurally malformed contribution — an unknown path, a
non-leaf address, or a value of the wrong type for the node — fails the
same way. A tool package whose facade fails to import (raised as
ImportError at the registry build) stops the command the same way, the
error naming the package — keep the package facade import-clean.
Semantic validity of well-formed values stays with the
consumers, exactly as with the authored file.

## The run output

When amendments are applied, the command prints a short summary to
stderr: one header plus one line per applied amendment — the tool, the
path, set or forced — in enumeration order. Configuration values
(including environment values) never appear in the summary or any
informational output. `goga config` stdout stays data-clean and prints
effective (amended) values. With no applied amendments nothing is
printed. The authored file is never modified — after the run it is
byte-identical, and repeated runs reproduce the same effective
configuration.

## Integration scenarios

- **Config-aware decisions** — read `context.config` (is a build agent
  configured? which review roles? which env keys present?) and shape your
  contributions to the other domains accordingly.
- **Prepared parameter set on a minimal config** — `set` the knobs the
  author left unset; the absent branches materialize.
- **Risk mitigation** — `force` a safer value over a risky authored one;
  the override is visible in the summary.
- **Routine setup simplification** — `set` `pipeline.env.KEY` entries the
  author did not write, composed from the values you read.
