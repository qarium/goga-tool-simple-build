# describe_pipeline — pipeline card without running

`describe_pipeline` composes the card of a single pipeline: the authored name and description
from the DSL header, plus the stage list (id and title per stage) in execution order — the
composition a run of the same pipeline with the same workflow and skip flags would execute. The
card composes through the pipeline hooks zone — the same amendment layer with the same
precedence a run applies — and names the tools whose contributions committed into the
composition. No run events fire in card form. Nothing is launched and nothing is written into
the project or runtime directories.

## Usage

```python
from pathlib import Path
from goga.pipeline import describe_pipeline

card = describe_pipeline(
    name="deploy",
    project_dir=Path("/workspace/.goga/pipelines"),
    user_dir=Path("/home/goga/.goga/pipelines"),
    workflow="hardening",  # explicit workflow; None → basename auto-match
    no_workflow=False,
    skip=["build"],  # skip names; None → no skip
)
print(f"name: {card.name}")
print(f"description: {card.description}")
print()
print("---")
print()
for stage in card.stages:
    print(f"* {stage.id}:")
    print(f"    title: {stage.title}")
```

## Parameters

- `name: str` — pipeline name without extension
- `project_dir: Path` — project pipelines directory (absolute)
- `user_dir: Path` — user pipelines directory (absolute)
- `workflow: str | None` — explicit workflow name without the `.yml` extension; `None` with
  `no_workflow=False` resolves the basename auto-match (`<name>.yml` in `.goga/workflows/`); a
  missing file is a silent miss
- `no_workflow: bool` — when True, no workflow is applied and the raw DSL composition is
  reported (CLI skip names still compose)
- `skip: list[str] | None` — stage names to skip, merged exactly as a run with the same flags
  merges them; `None` and empty both mean no skip

Returns `PipelineCard`.

## The models

`PipelineCard` — `@dataclass(kw_only=True)`:

- `name: str` — pipeline name from the DSL header
- `description: str` — pipeline description from the DSL header
- `stages: list[CardStage]` — stage rows in execution order
- `provenance: list[str]` — the tools whose contributions committed into the composition, in
  enumeration order; empty when none contributed

`CardStage` — `@dataclass(kw_only=True)`:

- `id: str` — stage identifier
- `title: str` — stage display title

## Workflow and skip equivalence

`workflow` / `no_workflow` / `skip` follow one rule set shared with run coordination: disabled →
raw composition; explicit name → that workflow file; otherwise basename auto-match; a missing
file is a silent miss. The skip names merge onto the resolved workflow in-memory — the same
merge a run applies. The card composes through the pipeline hooks zone with the same precedence
a run applies — the same flags produce the same composition and the same provenance in both
forms, and the card names the contributing tools (`card.provenance`). The stage composition is
produced by the same compilation machine a run uses, so loop-expanded copies appear as separate
rows with their generated ids, and skipped stages disappear from the list exactly as they
disappear from a run. No run events fire in card form.

## Side effects

- Reads the pipeline-file and, when one resolves, the workflow-file.
- Writes one temporary flow-file in the system temporary directory (outside the project and
  runtime directories) and removes it before returning.

## Preconditions

- Both directories must be absolute.
- An unknown `name` raises a readable error naming the pipeline.
- A damaged pipeline-file or workflow-file raises a readable structural error.

## Anti-patterns

- Do not apply skip by rewriting the workflow-file — the merge is in-memory; pass the names.
- Do not treat the card as a launch — no afm invocation, no agents, no state changes.
