# List Pipelines — goga/pipeline

## Overview

`list_pipelines` discovers pipeline files across two source directories and
returns them as `PipelineEntry`-s. Use this when you need to enumerate available
pipelines (for CLI output, validation, or selection UIs). Inside the goga
Docker image, the source directories are resolved relative to the container's
filesystem (`/workspace/.goga/pipelines/` and `/home/goga/.goga/pipelines/`).

## Source Directories

| Parameter      | In-container typical path           | Meaning                                                  |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `project_dir`  | `/workspace/.goga/pipelines/`       | Project-level pipelines, user-authored. Priority source. |
| `user_dir`     | `/home/goga/.goga/pipelines/`       | User-level pipelines, installed by `goga connect`.       |

When a pipeline name exists in both, the project source wins.

## Usage

```python
from pathlib import Path
from goga.pipeline import PipelineEntry, list_pipelines

project_dir = Path("/workspace/.goga/pipelines")
user_dir = Path("/home/goga/.goga/pipelines")

entries: list[PipelineEntry] = list_pipelines(project_dir, user_dir)
for entry in entries:
    print(f"{entry.name} ({entry.source.value})")
```

## Parameters

- `project_dir: Path` — project pipelines directory (scanned flat, non-recursive)
- `user_dir: Path` — user pipelines directory (scanned flat, non-recursive)

Returns `list[PipelineEntry]` — one entry per unique name; duplicates resolved toward project source.

## The PipelineEntry model

```python
from goga.pipeline import PipelineEntry, PipelineSource

entry = PipelineEntry(name="deploy", source=PipelineSource.PROJECT)
entry.name  # "deploy"
entry.source  # PipelineSource.PROJECT (== "project", str-backed)
```

`PipelineEntry` is a `@dataclass(kw_only=True)` with two fields. The `name` is
validated in `__post_init__`: it must not contain path separators (`/`, `\`),
must not end with `.yml`, and must not be empty. Invalid names raise `ValueError`.

`PipelineSource` is a str-backed enum: `PipelineSource.PROJECT = "project"`,
`PipelineSource.USER = "user"`.

## Side Effects

- Reads the filesystem only (no writes).

## Preconditions

- Pipeline files must reside at the top level of a source directory (subdirectories are not scanned).
- Pipeline file names must use the `.yml` extension; the returned `PipelineEntry.name` omits it.
- Stems that fail `PipelineEntry` validation are silently skipped — they are not pipelines.
- The host-side launcher (`goga/commands/pipeline`) always runs discovery inside the container — never on the host.

## Anti-patterns

- Do not scan subdirectories — only flat `*.yml` is supported.
- Do not assume pipelines from `.flowManager/flows/` will appear — that directory is afm's own runtime directory and unrelated.
- Do not construct `PipelineEntry` with `name="deploy.yml"` or `name="a/b"` — the validator rejects these.
- Do not call `list_pipelines` from the host — discovery is in-container only; the host invokes `python -m goga.pipeline list` via docker.
