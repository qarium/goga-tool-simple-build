# Run Ralphex — goga/ralphex

## Overview

`run_ralphex` is a thin launcher over the external `ralphex` binary. It invokes ralphex
with a resolved plan path and resolved ralphex options, then propagates the subprocess
exit code. `run_ralphex` performs no config generation (`.ralphex/config`), no ralphex
option resolution (CLI > config > omit), and no agent-wrapper resolution — the
caller (typically `build()` in `goga/build`) resolves the plan, resolves the options with
the CLI/config precedence applied, generates the `.ralphex/config`, and only then calls
`run_ralphex` to launch.

## Usage

```python
from goga.ralphex import run_ralphex

plan = "docs/plans/my-plan.md"  # resolved by the caller (goga/build)
options = {  # resolved ralphex options (precedence applied by the caller)
    "max_iterations": 50,
    "session_timeout": "30m",
    "tasks_only": False,  # True → --tasks-only (the tasks pass)
    "review": False,  # True → --review (the review pass)
    "external_only": False,  # True → -e (the external-only review pass)
}
dry_run = False

exit_code = run_ralphex(plan, options, dry_run)
```

Two-pass composition is the only form: every non-skipped run is a tasks pass
(`--tasks-only`) then, on its success, a review pass (`--review`, or `-e` under
the short strategy) — regardless of executor configuration. The pass-mode flags
are mutually exclusive per invocation; the review-scoped keys (`base_ref`,
`review_patience`, `max_external_iterations`) join the review pass alone, never
the tasks pass:

```python
# Pass 1 — tasks only (task wrapper in .ralphex/config claude_command).
# Universal options only: a review diff base here would scope the wrong phase.
exit_code = run_ralphex(plan, {**options, "tasks_only": True}, dry_run)
# Pass 2 (only on pass-1 success) — review only (review wrapper rewritten
# into claude_command), carrying the review-scoped options
if exit_code == 0:
    exit_code = run_ralphex(plan, {**options, "review": True}, dry_run)
```

```python
# Review pass scoped to a diff base: base_ref maps to --base-ref and is
# omitted when None or empty — run_ralphex never validates the ref
exit_code = run_ralphex(plan, {**options, "review": True, "base_ref": "origin/1.2.x"}, dry_run)
```

```python
# Review pass with an env layer: keys of env override the inherited
# environment for this subprocess only; the tasks pass runs without a layer.
exit_code = run_ralphex(plan, {**options, "review": True}, dry_run, env={"ANTHROPIC_MODEL": "reviewer-model"})
```

## Parameters

- `plan: str` — path to the plan file (markdown), resolved by the caller. Passed to
  ralphex as the positional argument.
- `options: dict` — resolved ralphex options. The caller has already applied CLI >
  config > omit precedence; `run_ralphex` maps each resolved key to its ralphex
  CLI flag (see the option→flag table in its CODEMANIFEST contract) — it performs no
  precedence resolution. Bool keys include `tasks_only` (True → bare `--tasks-only`,
  the tasks pass), `review` (True → bare `--review`, the review-only pass), and
  `external_only` (True → bare `-e`, the external-only review pass); False or
  absent omits the flag, and the three pass-mode flags are mutually exclusive
  per invocation.
  Review-scoped keys — `review_patience`, `max_external_iterations`, and
  `base_ref` — map like any other key but belong on review-carrying passes only
  (the caller decides the pass composition). `base_ref` is forwarded verbatim
  and omitted from the command when None or an empty string. A scalar value of
  0 is omitted for every key EXCEPT the external flags: `review_patience` 0
  (disabled) and `max_external_iterations` 0 (ralphex auto) are meaningful and
  ARE passed as 0.
- `dry_run: bool` — when True, print the assembled ralphex command to sys.stderr and
  return 0 without launching.
- `env: dict[str, str] | None` — optional environment layer for the ralphex
  subprocess. Keys override same-named inherited variables; every other
  inherited variable passes through unchanged. `None`/`{}` — pure inheritance.
  The layer applies to this subprocess only; `dry_run` never prints it.

## Return Values

| Exit code | Condition |
|-----------|-----------|
| 0 | ralphex ran the plan successfully |
| 1 | `ralphex` not on `$PATH` inside the container — including when an `env` layer's `PATH` override hides it from the exec — or the launch was rejected before the exec (an `env` key that is not a legal variable name, an oversized layer, or a `PATH` override resolving a non-executable/non-directory ralphex); either way a clean one-line message goes to stderr, never a traceback |
| non-zero | ralphex itself returned a non-zero exit code |

## Side Effects

`run_ralphex` invokes `ralphex` as a subprocess and inherits all its side effects
(creates a branch, runs tasks, commits, reviews — as defined by the plan file). The build
environment is inherited from the process environment (delivered into the container via
the docker env-file by the host launcher).

## Preconditions

- The `ralphex` binary must be on `$PATH` inside the container (missing binary returns
  exit code 1). `run_ralphex` must not hard-code a binary path.
- `.ralphex/config` must already be generated by the caller (`build()` in goga/build).
- The ralphex options must already be resolved (CLI > config > omit) by the caller.
- The build environment is inherited from the process environment (delivered
  into the container via the docker env-file by the host launcher); the
  optional `env` argument is a caller-supplied overlay layer on top of it —
  `run_ralphex` builds the environment from no other source.

## Anti-patterns

- Do not pass unresolved options expecting `run_ralphex` to apply CLI/config precedence.
- Do not call `run_ralphex` before `.ralphex/config` is generated — config generation lives
  in the caller.
- Do not pass a build config object (`BuildConfig`/`ReviewConfig`) — `run_ralphex`
  takes resolved primitives only and imports nothing from `goga/config`.
- Do not pass `base_ref` expecting `run_ralphex` to validate or resolve the
  ref — the value is forwarded verbatim; ralphex resolves it.
