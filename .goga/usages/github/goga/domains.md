# Functional Domains — goga facade

The `goga` package is the root facade of the project. It re-exports the public surface (`AST`, `app`) and decomposes the system into top-level functional domain cells. Each domain owns an independent responsibility zone with a stable API boundary.

This document is an orientation map for consumers of the `goga` facade — it lists the top-level domains, their cell paths, and a one-line responsibility statement per domain. It does not impose any obligation on the domain cells; for behavioral contracts, consult the CODEMANIFEST of each cell.

## Domain packages

Each domain is imported directly from its subpackage:

```python
from goga.ast import AST
from goga.build import build
from goga.connect import connect
from goga.contract import contract
from goga.onboarding import InitLogic, Questionnaire
from goga.pipeline import run_pipeline
from goga.runtime import resolve_runtime_dir
from goga.scaffold import Scaffold
from goga.schema import schema
from goga.usages import sync
from goga.version import resolve_version
```

Note: `goga.ast` is the only domain re-exported at the facade level (`from goga import AST`). All other domains must be imported via their full subpackage path.

## Per-domain brief

### ast
Defines a project that constructs and validates a tree of CODEMANIFEST documents. Exposes the `AST` facade for navigation and the rule engine that enforces DSL correctness across the project.

### build
Owns the code build orchestration logic through ralphex. Coordinates container launch, runtime-directory preparation, and ralphex invocation.

### connect
Centralized goga skill/command/pipeline installation logic. Assets are installed once into `~/.goga/`, agents receive symlinks into `~/.goga/`, and a per-agent connection registry is maintained at `~/.goga/connect.yml`. Provides the shared re-sync that re-applies activation to every registered agent after a package change.

### contract
Working with an implemented contract in a programming language. Dispatches to language-specific subcells (`goga/contract/python`, `goga/contract/golang`, `goga/contract/kotlin`, `goga/contract/swift`, `goga/contract/javascript`) and compares CODEMANIFEST signatures against the live implementation.

### onboarding
Interactive goga project initialization — user survey and configuration file generation. Drives the questionnaire, collects answers, and emits the project's `.goga/config.yml`.

### pipeline
Cell that owns the entire pipeline workflow: discovery of `*.yml` pipeline files across the project and user pipeline directories, the pipeline-file entity model, run coordination (including optional workflow resolution), and the in-container CLI entrypoint `pipeline_cli`.

### runtime
Pure leaf utilities module for runtime-directory path composition. Owns the single shared formula `~/.goga/runtime/<purpose>/<normalized_project>/<branch>/<*suffix_parts>` and exposes two atomic helpers plus one composite routine. Consumers call `resolve_runtime_dir` with their purpose and optional suffix.

### scaffold
Wraps the copier template engine for goga project scaffolding. Exposes the `Scaffold` facade with two operations: primary generation (`Scaffold.generate` via copier run_copy) and template migration (`Scaffold.upgrade` via copier run_update). Owns the goga hard conventions for the copier state file (`.goga/scaffold.yml`) shared by both operations.

### schema
This manifest defines how the `schema` routine generates the CODEMANIFEST project JSON schema.

### usages
Config-driven synchronization of cell-level usages from declared git dependencies into `.goga/usages/<group>/<dep>/`.

### version
Leaf cell that owns version semantics. Provides the four-form version grammar with its pip-specifier transformers (`resolve_version`, `resolve_relative_spec`), the single reading point for the host goga version (`host_goga_version`), and the host–image version consistency check over version strings (`compare_versions`, `version_check_enabled`, `ensure_version_match`). The cell is pure with respect to containers — callers pass already-obtained version strings; no docker invocations live here.
